# dockAI â€” Where Docker Meets AI

> 15 years of Containers. Still leading in the age of GenAI.

Welcome to **dockAI**, an open-source initiative by [Rahul Chaubey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaubeyrahul/) under **Cloudivio Labs**, focused on teaching Containers from the **kernel to GenAI deployment**.

---

##  What's Inside
-  Beginner to Expert Docker Concepts  
-  Internals: UnionFS, Namespaces, Cgroups, Life of a Packet  
-  BuildKit, Buildx, Multi-Platform Builds  
-  Security: SBOM, Cosign, Rootless Docker  
-  Deploying AI/GenAI Models on Containers  
-  Real Labs across AWS, Azure, and Oracle Cloud  

---

##  Why This Exists
Even after a decade, **containers continue to evolve**, now powering **AI pipelines, agent frameworks, and inference workloads**.  
dockAI is my attempt to **document, teach, and share** everything Iâ€™ve learned in this incredible journey.

---

##  Labs
All labs are structured step-by-step and tested on:
- Ubuntu 22.04 / Docker 27.x  
- AWS EC2 / Azure VM / OCI Compute  
- GPU-enabled container setups

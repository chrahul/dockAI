#  Lesson 8: Modern Image Building with BuildKit and Buildx

### *(Module 2 – Docker Images, Layers, and Build Fundamentals)*

---

##  Context

Until now, we’ve used Docker’s **classic builder**, which processes instructions sequentially and stores layer cache locally.
That worked fine when Dockerfiles were small — but in 2025, multi-arch builds, secure pipelines, and cloud runners need more power.

Enter **BuildKit** — the modern engine introduced by Docker that:

* Builds **in parallel** instead of one layer at a time
* Reuses **remote cache** across machines
* Supports **secrets**, **SSH mounts**, and **inline cache exports**
* Enables **multi-platform images** with `buildx`

BuildKit is now the *default* in Docker Desktop and Enterprise, and mastering it separates beginner image builders from professional DevOps engineers.

---

##  Learning Goals

 Understand how BuildKit differs from the legacy builder
 Enable and use BuildKit locally and in CI/CD
 Use `docker buildx` for multi-platform (amd64/arm64) builds
 Learn advanced caching: `--cache-from`, `--cache-to`
 Mount secrets and SSH keys safely during builds
 Push multi-arch images to Docker Hub or private registries

### 1️ What Is BuildKit?

**BuildKit** is a standalone build engine introduced by Moby (Docker’s upstream).
It brings parallel execution, distributed caching, and better logging.

**Classic vs BuildKit**

| Feature              | Classic Builder | BuildKit                          |
| -------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Layer execution      | Sequential      | Parallel (dependency graph)       |
| Cache reuse          | Local only      | Local + Remote                    |
| Secrets / SSH mounts | No               | Yes                                |
| Multi-arch builds    | No               | Yes (with `buildx`)                 |
| Output control       | Basic           | Advanced (`--output`, `--target`) |
| Logging              | Plain           | Structured, progressive           |

### 2️ Enabling BuildKit

You can enable it temporarily:

```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
```

Or permanently in Docker config:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "buildkit": true
  }
}
```

Check version:

```bash
docker buildx version
```

---

### 3️ BuildKit Workflow

When you build with BuildKit:

1. Docker CLI sends your Dockerfile + context to the BuildKit daemon.
2. BuildKit analyzes dependency graph (parallelizes steps).
3. Layers are executed concurrently when possible.
4. Cache metadata is stored in content-addressable format.

You’ll see progress bars like:

```
#1 [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile
#2 [internal] load .dockerignore
#3 [2/4] RUN apk add --no-cache curl
#4 [3/4] COPY . /app
```

---

### 4️ Secrets & SSH Mounts

Instead of baking credentials into images, BuildKit lets you **mount secrets** temporarily.

**Example:**

```Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.6
FROM alpine:3.20
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=api_key \
    cat /run/secrets/api_key
```

Provide secret file at build time:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --secret id=api_key,src=./apikey.txt .
```

 Secret is visible only during build, never persisted in layers.

---

### 5️ Buildx — Multi-Platform Builder

`buildx` extends BuildKit to build for multiple architectures:

* linux/amd64
* linux/arm64
* linux/ppc64le
* linux/s390x

Create and use a builder:

```bash
docker buildx create --name multi --use
docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
```

Build multi-arch image:

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t rahulchaubey/dockai-demo:multi \
  --push .
```

Pushes a **manifest list** containing both architectures.

Check manifest:

```bash
docker buildx imagetools inspect rahulchaubey/dockai-demo:multi
```

**Output (trimmed):**

```
Name: rahulchaubey/dockai-demo:multi
Manifests:
  - linux/amd64  (Digest: sha256:...)
  - linux/arm64  (Digest: sha256:...)
```

---

### 6️ Advanced Caching

#### Export cache:

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --cache-to=type=local,dest=cache-dir \
  -t cachetest:v1 .
```

#### Reuse cache:

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --cache-from=type=local,src=cache-dir \
  -t cachetest:v2 .
```

This enables CI/CD systems to **reuse cached layers** across runners.

---

### 7️ Inspect Build Graph

You can visualize BuildKit’s execution graph:

```bash
docker buildx build --progress=plain .
```

Look for:

```
#3 [2/4] RUN ...
#5 [4/4] COPY ...
```

Parallel numbering means concurrent execution.

---

##  Labs — Step-by-Step

### Lab 8.1 — Enable BuildKit

```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
docker build -t buildkit-demo .
```

Observe structured logs:

```
#2 [internal] load .dockerignore
#3 [2/4] RUN echo "Using BuildKit"
```

---

### Lab 8.2 — Parallel Builds

**Dockerfile**

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.20
RUN sleep 2 && echo "Task A"
RUN sleep 2 && echo "Task B"
RUN sleep 2 && echo "Task C"
```

Build:

```bash
docker build --progress=plain -t parallel-demo .
```

You’ll notice all three `RUN` steps run **concurrently**.
In classic Docker, they’d execute sequentially (6 s total).
With BuildKit → ~2 s.

---

### Lab 8.3 — Using Secrets

```bash
echo "TOP_SECRET_KEY=abc123" > secret.txt
```

**Dockerfile**

```Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.6
FROM alpine:3.20
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=top_secret cat /run/secrets/top_secret
```

Build:

```bash
docker build --secret id=top_secret,src=secret.txt .
```

**Output**

```
#4 [2/2] RUN --mount=type=secret,id=top_secret cat /run/secrets/top_secret
TOP_SECRET_KEY=abc123
```

 Secret used, not stored in layer.

---

### Lab 8.4 — Multi-Platform Build

```bash
docker buildx create --use
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t rahulchaubey/demo:multi --push .
```

Inspect manifest:

```bash
docker buildx imagetools inspect rahulchaubey/demo:multi
```

Output shows multiple platforms.

---

### Lab 8.5 — Cache Export/Import

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --cache-to=type=local,dest=/tmp/buildcache \
  -t app:v1 .
```

Next build:

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --cache-from=type=local,src=/tmp/buildcache \
  -t app:v2 .
```

Output confirms reused layers.

---

##   Notes

* **BuildKit is now the default** — no need for experimental flags.
* Use `# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.x` for advanced features.
* Use secrets instead of ARG for sensitive data.
* Always build multi-arch images when targeting cloud platforms (AWS Graviton, Apple M-series).
* Remote caching saves significant build minutes in CI.

---

##  Summary

* BuildKit modernizes Docker builds: faster, secure, portable.
* Buildx adds multi-arch and advanced cache control.
* Secrets and SSH mounts keep builds safe.
* Parallel execution and cache export/import make CI/CD pipelines enterprise-grade.

###  Next Lesson → **Lesson 9: Image Security and SBOM**

We’ll conclude Module 2 by scanning images, generating SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials), and signing images using **Cosign** and **Docker Scout**.

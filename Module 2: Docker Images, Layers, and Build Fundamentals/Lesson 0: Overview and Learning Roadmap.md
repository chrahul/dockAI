#  **Module 2: Docker Images, Layers, and Build Fundamentals**

### *Lesson 0 – Overview and Learning Roadmap*

---

##  **Context**

Now that we understand **how Docker runs containers**, it’s time to explore **what those containers are built from** — the **images**.

Module 1 answered *“How Docker works.”*
Module 2 answers *“How Docker builds and stores what it runs.”*

This is where we dive under `/var/lib/docker/overlay2`, understand **layer caching**, learn how **Dockerfiles** actually work, and master **BuildKit**, **Buildx**, and **optimization strategies** used in enterprise CI/CD pipelines.

By the end of this module, you won’t just write Dockerfiles — you’ll engineer **efficient, reproducible, secure image pipelines** like a pro.

##  **What You’ll Learn in Module 2**

| Lesson       | Topic                                                | Key Skills You’ll Gain                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lesson 5** | **Docker Images, Layers, and the Union File System** | Understand image internals, AUFS vs overlay2, inspect layer diffs |
| **Lesson 6** | **Dockerfile Instructions & Build Context**          | Learn every Dockerfile instruction and how context works          |
| **Lesson 7** | **Build Optimization & Layer Caching**               | Design smaller, faster, cache-friendly images                     |
| **Lesson 8** | **Modern Image Building with BuildKit and Buildx**   | Parallel builds, multi-platform images, cache exports             |
| **Lesson 9** | **Best Practices & Security Scanning**               | SBOM, Trivy, and secure image pipelines                           |

##  **dockAI Visual Style for Module 2**

* Blue → System / OS layer
* Orange → Docker Image & Build logic
* Yellow → Storage & Layer visualization
* Purple → BuildKit / Buildx concepts

---

##  **Outcome of Module 2**

After completing this module, you’ll be able to:
 Explain how Docker images are stored and layered
 Build optimized Dockerfiles for production
 Understand how caching and Copy-on-Write improve builds
 Use BuildKit and Buildx confidently
 Embed security scanning into image pipelines
